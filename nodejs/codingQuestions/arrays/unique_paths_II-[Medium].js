    Follow up for Unique Paths.

    Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

    An obstacle and empty space as 1 and 0 respectivley in the grid.

    For example,
    There is one obstacle in the moddle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

    [
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ]

    The total number of unique paths is 2.

    Note m and n will be at most 100.
